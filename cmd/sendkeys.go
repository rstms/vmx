var sendkeysCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use: "sendkeys VID KEYS",
	Short: "send keystrokes to the instance",
	Long: `
Translate the KEYS argument into HID scan codes and send the result to the
selected instance using the vmcli utility on the host.

Quoting:
In bash, use single quotes around KEYS, backslash-escape double quotes, and
escape any single quotes using backslash-escaped hex (\x27).  Standard 
backslash escapes such as \n are decoded.

Examples:
vmx sendkeys testvm 'This has a \x27quoted\x27 elements\n'
vmx sendkeys testvm 'This has a \"double-quoted\" element\n'
vmx sendkeys testvm 'This has a `backquoted` element.\n'
vmx sendkeys testvm 'echo $PATH\n'
